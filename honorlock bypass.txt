edit registry (remove anything and everything VM related)
Registry location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Enum

Use Ctrl+F to locate the following keys

1st: 4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318
2nd: 4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318
3rd: 4d36e965-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318
4th-7th: 4d36e96f-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318

(the above will make it so Honorlock does not detect you are using a virtual machine)


remove vm tools from program list

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

right click < new < add DWORD < Name SystemComponet set value to 1

(The above will hide the VM from anyone poking around your machine to see if you are running a virtual machine)



(optional)
disconnect NAT from VM, plug in wifi adapter and run wifi adapter for VM but use wifi/ethernet for host OS


(the above will remove your "shared" IP address so people cant see you google stuff outside of the VMware session)
